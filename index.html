    <p>As a civil engineering student with a passion for coding, I am excited to bring my strong Python skills to a career in software development. Throughout my academic career, I have consistently sought out opportunities to learn and apply programming concepts to real-world engineering challenges.<br>My technical skills include proficiency in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization, and familiarity with software development tools such as Git and Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, my experience working in collaborative team environments has honed my communication and problem-solving skills, making me a valuable addition to any software development team.<br>In addition to my technical skills, I am also deeply committed to pursuing a career that makes a positive impact on society. I believe that technology has the potential to solve many of the world's most pressing challenges, and I am excited to be a part of that mission.<br>I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to meaningful software projects. If you are interested in connecting or learning more about my experience, please feel free to reach out.</p>
